## Building the Missing Pieces of Modern Workflows

Businesses today are increasingly assembling their own operational stacks: connecting flexible tools to create custom workflows instead of relying on rigid, end-to-end software. But while no-code and automation platforms are powerful, they often fall short when teams need advanced functionality such as intelligent routing, dynamic assignments, usage tracking, or analytics. When these gaps appear, companies face a costly choice: build internal workarounds or migrate to a new platform that supports the missing feature, wasting time retraining teams and reconfiguring integrations.

EnforcedFlow exists to eliminate that trade-off. Our vision is to build a suite of modular, plug-and-play workflow components: the missing building blocks modern businesses need to extend their automation stacks. Each EnforcedFlow module delivers enterprise-grade reliability, scalability, and interoperability across diverse automation environments. We're creating the invisible infrastructure that lets companies evolve their workflows freely, without being constrained by the limitations of any single system.
