    <Fragment slot="subtitle">
      Businesses today are increasingly assembling their own operational stacks—connecting tools like Airtable, Google
      Sheets, and Zapier to create custom workflows instead of relying on rigid, end-to-end software. But while these
      no-code platforms are powerful, they often fall short when teams need advanced functionality—things like
      intelligent routing, dynamic assignments, usage tracking, or workflow analytics. When these gaps appear, companies
      face a costly choice: build internal workarounds, or migrate to a new vendor that supports the feature, wasting
      time retraining teams and reconfiguring integrations. EnforcedFlow exists to eliminate that trade-off. Our vision
      is to build a suite of modular, plug-and-play workflow components—the missing building blocks modern businesses
      need to extend their existing automation stacks. Each EnforcedFlow module provides enterprise-grade reliability,
      scalability, and interoperability across platforms like Zapier, Make, and n8n. From lead routing to task
      allocation to intelligent data syncing—we're creating the invisible infrastructure that lets companies evolve
      their workflows freely, without being trapped by the limitations of any one vendor.
