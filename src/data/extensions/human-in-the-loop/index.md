## What is Human-in-the-Loop?

Human-in-the-Loop is an approval workflow extension that adds a human review step to your automations. It's specifically designed for AI-powered workflows where you want to verify, approve, or reject automated outputs before they're sent or published.

Think of it as a safety checkpoint in your automation - AI generates the content, a human reviews it, and only approved items continue through the workflow.

## When to Use Human-in-the-Loop

Real-world scenarios where the extension is used:

1. **Approve AI-generated responses to Google Business reviews before posting publicly** - Ensure brand voice and tone are appropriate for each customer interaction

2. **Final sign-off on AI-qualified sales leads before routing to your team** - Verify lead quality and fit before sales reps invest time

3. **Review AI-written customer support responses before sending** - Catch potential misunderstandings or tone issues that could damage customer relationships

4. **Approve AI-generated social media posts before publishing** - Maintain brand consistency and avoid PR risks from automated content

## Key Features

1. **Straightforward integration** - Either use Zapier extension or API to create a human in the loop task and get a review link.

2. **Simple review interface** - Review generated content along with a helpful context, add helpful notes for the reviewer.

3. **Metadata support** - In addition to reviewing main content, pass additional metadata and make it visible to review and can be used to control the next steps in the workflow (Eg: pass customer email, ticket id).

4. **AI assistant to quickly refine content** - Instead of manually editing, guide the inbuilt chat assistant to update the output content quickly.

5. **Batch support** - Group pending tasks and review multiple items together in one session.
