Responding to Google Business reviews is crucial for customer engagement, local SEO, and brand reputation. However, manually crafting responses is time-consuming, and fully automated AI responses risk posting mistakes publicly - like misreading complaint severity, hallucinating policies, or responding in the wrong tone.

This guide shows you how to build an automation that:

1. Automatically generates AI-powered responses to new reviews
2. Routes responses through a human approval workflow
3. Posts approved responses back to Google Business Profile

This gives you the time-saving benefits of automated drafts with human oversight to catch issues before they go public.

## How It Works

This automation requires **two Zaps** working together:

**Zap 1: Generate and Submit for Approval**

1. Triggers when a new review is posted to your Google Business Profile
2. Uses AI to generate a response based on the review
3. Creates a Human-in-the-Loop task for review and approval
4. Sends an email notification with the review link

**Zap 2: Post Approved Responses**

1. Triggers when a Human-in-the-Loop task is reviewed
2. Filters to only process approved responses
3. Posts the approved response to Google Business Profile

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

1. A free API key from EnforcedFlow (<a href="https://app.enforcedflow.com/register" target="_blank">sign up here</a>)
2. Google Business Profile connected to your Zapier account

## Part 1: Building the Review Response Generator (Zap 1)

### Step 1: Set Up the Google Business Profile Trigger

<MultiColumn ratio="equal" gap="md">
  <div slot="left">
    Create a new Zap and select **Google Business Profile** as your trigger app.

    Choose **New Review** as the trigger event. This will fire whenever someone leaves a review on your Google Business Profile.

    **Configuration:**

    1. **App**: Google Business Profile
    2. **Trigger event**: New Review
    3. **Account**: Connect your Google Business Profile account

    Test the trigger to ensure it's working correctly and pulling in review data.

  </div>

  <div slot="right">
    ![Google Business Profile trigger setup with New Review event selected](~/assets/images/extensions/human-in-the-loop/use-cases/google-business-review/00-zap1-gbp-trigger-setup.png)
  </div>
</MultiColumn>

### Step 2: Configure AI Response Generation

<MultiColumn ratio="equal" gap="md">
  <div slot="left">
    Add **AI by Zapier** as your next action step.

    Select **Analyze and Return Data** as the action event.

    **Configuration:**

    1. **Provider**: OpenAI
    2. **Model**: openai/gpt-4o-mini (cost-effective and fast)
    3. **Input fields**: Map the review comment from Step 1
    4. **Prompt**: Craft instructions for generating responses

    **Example prompt:**
    ```
    Come up with a reply to the given review in under 200 characters.
    If any issues are mentioned, state that we're actively working to
    resolve them. Thank the reviewer for their feedback.
    ```

    5. **Output fields**: Create a field called "reply"
    6. **Return as array**: Set to False

  </div>

  <div slot="right">
    ![AI step configuration showing OpenAI settings and prompt](~/assets/images/extensions/human-in-the-loop/use-cases/google-business-review/01-zap1-ai-step-configure.png)
  </div>
</MultiColumn>

### Step 3: Create Human-in-the-Loop Task

<MultiColumn ratio="equal" gap="md">
  <div slot="left">
    Add **EnforcedFlow** as your next action step.

    Select **Create Human in the Loop Task** as the action event.

    Connect your EnforcedFlow account when prompted.

  </div>

  <div slot="right">
    ![Search for EnforcedFlow](~/assets/images/extensions/human-in-the-loop/use-cases/google-business-review/02a-zap1-hil-app-search.png)

    ![EnforcedFlow action setup](~/assets/images/extensions/human-in-the-loop/use-cases/google-business-review/02-zap1-hil-step-setup.png)
  </div>
</MultiColumn>

<MultiColumn ratio="equal" gap="md">
  <div slot="left">
    **Configure the review task:**

    1. **Title**: "Google Business Review"
       - This appears at the top of the review interface

    2. **Review Guidelines**: "Make sure response match tone of our branding"
       - Gives reviewers context on what to check

    3. **Content to Review**: Map the AI-generated reply from Step 2
       - This is what the reviewer can edit and approve

    4. **Source Content (Reference for Reviewer)**: Map the original review comment
       - Provides context so reviewers understand what they're responding to

    5. **Metadata**: Add these key-value pairs:
       - **ReviewerName**: Map the reviewer's name from Step 1
       - **Rating**: Map the star rating from Step 1
       - This data passes through and will be available in Zap 2

    6. **Allow metadata to be edited**: Set to False

    7. **Group Name**: "business-review"
       - Critical! This connects Zap 1 to Zap 2

  </div>

  <div slot="right">
    ![Human-in-the-Loop task configuration with all fields filled](~/assets/images/extensions/human-in-the-loop/use-cases/google-business-review/03-zap1-hil-step-configure.png)
  </div>
</MultiColumn>

**Why Group Name Matters:**

The Group Name acts as a unique identifier that links your two Zaps together. When Zap 2's trigger listens for reviewed tasks, it will ONLY pick up tasks from this group. This prevents cross-contamination if you have multiple review workflows.

Additionally, grouping lets you review all pending tasks for this group at once - so you can approve multiple review responses in a single session instead of handling them one by one, saving significant time.

<MultiColumn ratio="equal" gap="md">
  <div slot="left">
    **Run Test** to verify the step is working. This will return a review URL as shown in the screenshot.

  </div>

  <div slot="right">
    ![Test output showing the review URL and task ID](~/assets/images/extensions/human-in-the-loop/use-cases/google-business-review/04-zap1-hil-step-test.png)
  </div>
</MultiColumn>

**What you'll see when you open the review URL:**

<MultiColumn ratio="equal" gap="md">
  <div slot="left">
    When you click the review URL from the test output, you'll see a clean, focused interface showing:

    1. **The title and guidelines** you configured
    2. **The original review** for context
    3. **The AI-generated response** (fully editable)
    4. **An AI assistant** to quickly refine the content
    5. **Action buttons**: Start Over, Reject, or Approve

    **Using the AI Refinement Feature:**

    Instead of manually editing, you can use the "Ask AI to tweak the content" feature to quickly adjust the response. For example:
    - "Make it shorter"
    - "Add more enthusiasm"
    - "Change tone to professional"
    - "Remove emojis"

    **For this test, click Approve** to create the sample data you'll need when setting up Zap 2's trigger in the next part of this guide.

  </div>

  <div slot="right">
    ![Review interface showing the AI-generated response with editing options](~/assets/images/extensions/human-in-the-loop/use-cases/google-business-review/05-review-interface.png)
  </div>
</MultiColumn>

### Step 4: Send Review Link to Approver

<MultiColumn ratio="equal" gap="md">
  <div slot="left">
    Add **Email by Zapier** as your final action step.

    Select **Send Outbound Email** as the action event.

    **Configure the email:**

    1. **To**: Enter the email address(es) of your reviewer(s)
    2. **Subject**: "New Business Profile Review"
    3. **Body**: Include the review link from Step 3

    **Alternative notification methods:**
    - Send to Slack instead of email
    - Create a task in ClickUp or Asana
    - Add to a shared Google Sheet

  </div>

  <div slot="right">
    ![Email configuration with review link in body](~/assets/images/extensions/human-in-the-loop/use-cases/google-business-review/06-zap1-email-step.png)
  </div>
</MultiColumn>

### Your Complete Zap 1 Should Look Like This:

<div class="mx-auto max-w-full md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-sm">

![Complete overview of Zap 1 with all four steps](~/assets/images/extensions/human-in-the-loop/use-cases/google-business-review/07-zap1-overview.png)

</div>

1. Google Business Profile - New Review
2. AI by Zapier - Analyze and Return Data
3. EnforcedFlow - Create Human in the Loop Task
4. Email by Zapier - Send Outbound Email

**Before turning on Zap 1:** Make sure you've approved the test review task from Step 3. This sample data is necessary for setting up Zap 2 in the next section.

**Turn on your Zap** once you've tested it successfully.

## Part 2: Building the Response Posting Automation (Zap 2)

Now we'll create the second Zap that listens for approved reviews and posts them to Google Business Profile.

### Step 1: Set Up EnforcedFlow Trigger

<MultiColumn ratio="equal" gap="md">
  <div slot="left">
    Create a new Zap and select **EnforcedFlow** as your trigger app.

    Choose **Human in Loop Task Reviewed** as the trigger event.

    Connect your EnforcedFlow account (same account as Zap 1).

  </div>

  <div slot="right">
    ![EnforcedFlow trigger setup](~/assets/images/extensions/human-in-the-loop/use-cases/google-business-review/09-zap2-trigger-hil-setup.png)
  </div>
</MultiColumn>

<MultiColumn ratio="equal" gap="md">
  <div slot="left">
    **Configure the trigger:**

    **Group Name**: "business-review"

    This MUST match exactly what you used in Zap 1, Step 3. This ensures this Zap only processes Google Business review tasks, not other types of tasks you might have.

  </div>

  <div slot="right">
    ![Group name configuration matching Zap 1](~/assets/images/extensions/human-in-the-loop/use-cases/google-business-review/10-zap2-trigger-group-name.png)
  </div>
</MultiColumn>

<MultiColumn ratio="equal" gap="md">
  <div slot="left">
    **Test the trigger** to pull in a sample reviewed task.

    *Note: This should pull in the sample task you approved when testing Zap 1, Step 3. If no data appears, go back to Zap 1, run the test again, and approve the task.*

    The trigger will return rich data including:

    - **ID**: Task identifier
    - **Title**: "Google Business Review"
    - **Notes**: Your review guidelines
    - **Source Content**: The original review
    - **Original Content**: The AI's initial response
    - **Approved Content**: The final approved response (this is what we'll post!)
    - **Review Outcome**: "approved" or "rejected"
    - **Metadata**: ReviewerName, Rating, and other data you passed through

    This data gives you everything you need to post the response.

  </div>

  <div slot="right">
    ![Test data showing all the information returned by the trigger](~/assets/images/extensions/human-in-the-loop/use-cases/google-business-review/11-zap2-trigger-test.png)
  </div>
</MultiColumn>

### Step 2: Filter for Approved Responses Only

<MultiColumn ratio="equal" gap="md">
  <div slot="left">
    Add a **Filter by Zapier** step.

    **Configure the filter:**

    **Only continue if:**
    - Field: `1. Review Outcome`
    - Condition: `(Text) Exactly matches`
    - Value: `approved`

    This ensures rejected reviews don't get posted. You could also create a separate automation to handle rejections (e.g., notify a manager or create a follow-up task).

    Test the filter to ensure it passes with "approved" outcomes.

  </div>

  <div slot="right">
    ![Filter configuration checking for approved outcome](~/assets/images/extensions/human-in-the-loop/use-cases/google-business-review/12-zap2-filter-step.png)
  </div>
</MultiColumn>

### Step 3: Post Response to Google Business Profile

<MultiColumn ratio="equal" gap="md">
  <div slot="left">
    Add **Google Business Profile** as your action step.

    Select **Create Reply** as the action event.

    Connect your Google Business Profile account (same as Zap 1).

  </div>

  <div slot="right">
    ![Google Business Profile action setup](~/assets/images/extensions/human-in-the-loop/use-cases/google-business-review/13-zap2-reply-setup.png)
  </div>
</MultiColumn>

<MultiColumn ratio="equal" gap="md">
  <div slot="left">
    **Configure the reply:**

    1. **Review Name**: Map `1. Metadata Reviewer Name` from the trigger
       - This is the unique identifier for the review in Google's system

    2. **Your Reply**: Map `1. Approved Content` from the trigger
       - This contains the final, human-approved response text

    Test this step to ensure the reply posts correctly.

  </div>

  <div slot="right">
    ![Reply configuration mapping approved content](~/assets/images/extensions/human-in-the-loop/use-cases/google-business-review/14-zap2-reply-configure.png)
  </div>
</MultiColumn>

**Turn on your Zap** once testing is successful.

## Advanced Customization Ideas

Once you have the basic automation working, consider these enhancements:

**1. Sentiment-Based Routing**

- Add a sentiment analysis step
- Route negative reviews to senior staff
- Auto-approve very positive, simple reviews

**2. Response Templates**

- Create different AI prompts for different star ratings
- Use Zapier Paths to route to different prompts

**3. Multi-Location Support**

- Add location as metadata
- Route reviews to location-specific managers
- Use location-specific brand voice in prompts
