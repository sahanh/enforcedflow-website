Ever needed to distribute leads or tasks evenly across your team in Zapier? Traditional round robin setups often involve complex configurations with storage steps, lookup tables, or Google Sheets management.

## The Old Way vs The New Way

Traditionally, setting up round robin in Zapier required:

- Creating storage values for counters
- Setting up lookup tables or Google Sheets
- Managing MOD functions and formulas
- Writing Javascript for reset logic
- Maintaining multiple Zap steps

With the EnforcedFlow Round Robin action, it's as simple as:

- Add the Round Robin action to your Zap (1)
- Enter your team members as key-value pairs, give the group a name (2)
- That's it! The action will round robin and return the next option each time
- Bonus: You can use the same group with same option in other Zaps!
