## What is Simple Round Robin?

Simple Round Robin is a straightforward task distribution method that cycles through your team members in order. When a new item arrives (ticket, lead, form submission), it's automatically assigned to the next person in rotation.

Think of it like dealing cards - each person gets one, then the next person, and so on until you loop back to the first person.

## When to Use Simple Round Robin

‚úÖ **Use when:**
- You need equal distribution across a team
- All team members have similar skills/capacity
- Assignment logic is straightforward
- You want quick setup without complex rules
- Team size is consistent

‚ùå **Don't use when:**
- Team members have different skill sets (use [Advanced Round Robin](/extensions/round-robin))
- You need time-based or weighted assignment
- Priority affects who should receive tasks
- You need approval workflows (use [Human-in-the-Loop](/extensions/human-in-the-loop))

## Key Features

### Sequential Rotation
Simple, predictable assignment:
- Person A ‚Üí Person B ‚Üí Person C ‚Üí Person A...
- Maintains state across assignments
- No complex rules or conditions

### Equal Distribution
Everyone gets the same share:
- Fair workload across team
- No bias in assignment
- Transparent and predictable

### Quick Setup
Get started in minutes:
- Define your team list
- Add to Zapier workflow
- Start distributing

## Common Use Cases

**Support Ticket Distribution**
- Small support team (3-5 people)
- Similar skill levels
- Equal availability

**Form Lead Assignment**
- Sales team of equal capacity
- No territory or specialization
- Simple fair distribution

**Task Rotation**
- Team standups or duties
- On-call rotation
- Meeting note-taking assignments

**Email Assignment**
- Shared inbox distribution
- Customer inquiry routing
- General request handling

## How It Works

1. **Create your rotation** - Define team members in order
2. **Add to Zapier** - Include the extension in your workflow
3. **Items auto-assign** - Each new item goes to the next person in line
4. **Loop and repeat** - Rotation continues indefinitely

The extension tracks position in the rotation automatically, so you never have to manually manage who's next.

## Comparison: Simple vs Advanced
