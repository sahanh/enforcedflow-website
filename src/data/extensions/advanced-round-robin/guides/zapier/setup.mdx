The Advanced Round Robin extension allows you to set up complex lead routing among a group of agents based on:

1. Set of skills
2. Availability (day and time)
3. Weight/Priority

## Prerequisite

Before begin, [sign up](https://app.enforcedflow.com/register) for a free EnforcedFlow account.

<SetupGroup />

## Use it in Zapier

In Zapier, look for the **EnforcedFlow App** when setting up an action.

1.  Select **Get Next Agent (Advanced Round Robin)** as the Event.
2.  In the configuration step, select the newly created group from the dropdown.

Note: Only **multi-select** fields will be available in Zapier to provide data. The **Day and Time** and **Weight** fields are handled automatically.

<MultiColumn ratio="equal" gap="md">

  </div>
</MultiColumn>

###### Step in Action

If you set the skills to **"tech"** and test the step, you will see the routing in action. You can then use the agent information from the output.
